## Why Lexend?

For more than 60 years the U.S. Department of Education has found that nearly 70% of the population experiences some reading difficulty. In 1999, as an educational therapist, Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup, working with clients, began observing that reading issues masked the individualâ€™s true capability and intelligence. In 2000, Bonnie theorized that reading performance would improve through use of:
- **A sans-serif font to reduce cognitive noise**
- **Expanded scaling to improve potential for character recognition**
- **Hyper-expansion of character spacing, which creates a greater lag time and reduces potential crowding and masking effects**

These changes led to the development of seven specially-designed fonts, which create an immediate improvement in reading performance.

This is where Lexend was formed.


*17/19 students had better scores with Lexend over Times New Roman*
